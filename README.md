# BudgetPanda
A budgetting app that is as good as the user.

## Description
I'm creating this app as a practice in Java development from design to implementation. However, I'm hoping this app will be something I'd use in a daily basis to keep track of my purchases.

Some core functionalities that this app will have:
1. Creating/selecting a budget
2. Budget money into categories
3. Tracking financial accounts to be used in the budget
4. Debt/Financing management
5. Automatic monthly budgetting
6. Automatic recurring payments
