# BudgetPanda
A budgetting app that is as good as the user.

## Description
I'm creating this app as a practice in Java development from design to implementation. However, I'm hoping this app will be something I'd use in a daily basis to keep track of my purchases.

Some core functionalities that this app will have:
1. Creating/selecting a budget
2. Budget money into categories
3. Tracking financial accounts to be used in the budget
4. Debt/Financing management
5. Automatic monthly budgetting
6. Automatic recurring payments

My goal for this app is to not have a transactional sync up with the financial institutions, but rather let the user be his/her own keeper of transaction/budget. I firmly believe the "fire and forget" thinking does not work when it comes to managing finance. I've learned from using YNAB that having to input every transaction make me think before I buy and I wish to carry this mentality forward onto this app.
